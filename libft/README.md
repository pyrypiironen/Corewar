# libft
C library with useful functions.

## Usage:
- in root of repository: make (this will compile the library and create libft.a)
- in your main c-file, #include "libft.h"
- compile your main file with libft.a

### Why?
At Hive Helsinki, most projects allow only fundamental functions (open, close, read, write, malloc, free..).
If we want to use other functions (such as atoi, itoa, memcpy, printf) we have to create them ourselves.
Enter libft!
