- check negative values, labels in labels
- check too big integers as arguments
-----> % MEM_SIZE ?

Need to handle:

ERRORCASES:
mat.s
tcd2.s (if .extend is removed)
tcd3.s -||-
	- FIX: break and try for new argument if no valid is found, OR defend why this is better..
empty_comment1.s
empty_name1.s
invalid_label1.s && 2.s
no_label_name.s



VM:
- replicate bug of lld? read size of 2 instead of 4
- use of % MEM_SIZE to prevent overruns
- debug the loading and unloading into registrys, script different combinations

1. Tokenize V
	- no other types other than NEWLINE between NAME and COMMENT
 _Validate:
	- double check that a word does not end or begin with ':'

CHECK ORIG:
- same label name, different statements == Always refers to the first. Keep adding to list,
will return the first match.
- labels and their lines: write statements in order. label is only there to describe a statement,
to return the place in memory. ex: %:live turned out to be -5, because it is direct and the line before.
- arguments in weird positions, after newline etc.
- min/max values of arguments
- last bunch of labels followed by commented lines followed by statement

TEST:
file starts with number, comment, label, op
file stops with -||-

LIBFT errors:
- ft_printf seg faults when given extra %s that does not exist.
